    Decision Tree and Feature Importance

    <h1>Feature Importance</h1>
    This is an interactive visualization that illustrates a particular decision tree of the random forest. The earlier the feature is on the tree, the more important it is. You can hover over the right hand bars to see the specific % of importance. In addition, the thickness of the line also represents the degree of importance of that feature. You can also click on any of the circles to zoom into the specific branch to see precisely what the decision is tree is doing in order to predict the graduation rate. The bottom leaves represent the actual predicted value for the graduation rate. Note: Only a subset of the features are defined here. For full definitions, please refer to the detailed notebook.
